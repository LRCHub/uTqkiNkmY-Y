Open up your heart to me darling
You're resisting this bliss
You've been dreaming only of it
It's just like ice building up inside darling
We've accumulated too much miscommunication
In a beginning everything is soft
Not defensive
Perhaps we begin again shyly
I want to love you loosely
I want to love you loosely
So nothing is stopping me from receiving
From giving out
I want a storm to blow it out
I want to shake myself and turn my heart inside out
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
